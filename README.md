## Inbetween Release Packaging
1. Clone the repository to a local space on your machine (do this once).
2. Pull for recent commits.
3. Click on `UnrealPak/HellModPak.bat` and wait for the terminal to close.
4. Your local pak will be found in the top level directory with the name `666-ModName_P.pak`
5. Rename the pak according to naming conventions:
    1. `_P` cannot go before files without `_P`
    2. Overhauls should be loaded as high as possible and files that edit other mods come lower than the main ones).
